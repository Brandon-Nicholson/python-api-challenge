# python-api-challenge
In the first part of this Python challenge, I will be using APIs to access wordlwide weather data. With this data, I will create visualizations proving that weather is hotter closer to the equator.
In the second part of this challenge, I plan future vacations using APIs to access hotel locations in the areas with optimal weather.
